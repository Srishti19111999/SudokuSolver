# SudokuSolver
This is a Sudoku solver, where you can provide any unsolved Sudoku and it will generate a solved Sudoku grid if possible.
This is a desktop application developed using Java Swing. Here the user can copy any unsolved Sudoku, by filling up the grid's cell with numbers that are giving in the question,
using the number buttons provided and the click on Generate button.
The user can experience how the numbers are being backtracked, as there is a delay of 50ms, which makes it quite pleasing to the users eyes.
It is solving a Sudoku on the basis of Backtracking algorithm, where we recursively call the function to find the solution using Depth First Search approach.
